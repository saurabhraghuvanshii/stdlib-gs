# RULES #

#/
# Prints the runtime value of a `Makefile` variable.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make inspect.<variable>
#     ```
#
# @example
# make inspect.ROOT_DIR
#
# @example
# make inspect.CC
#/
inspect.%:
	$(QUIET) echo '$*=$($*)'

#/
# Asserts that a `Makefile` variable is set.
#
# ## Notes
#
# -   The rule uses the following format:
#
#     ```bash
#     $ make assert.<variable>
#     ```
#
# -   If a variable is **not** set, the recipe exits with a non-zero exit code.
#
# @example
# make inspect.CXX
#/
assert.%:
	$(QUIET) if [[ "${${*}}" = "" ]]; then \
		echo "\nError: You must set the environment variable: ${*}.\n"; \
		exit 1; \
	fi

#/
# Prints information regarding installed and/or missing dependencies.
#
# @example
# make deps-diagnostics
#/
